# LuaPanda


LuaPanda is a small 3D SceneKit game written mostly in Lua. It is based on a code sample from Apple.

You run the character —a red panda— in a 3D scene, with the arrow keys, and use the mouse to change the camera position. The character can collect pearls and flowers on his way, but it shall avoid to be touched by the enemy's fire.

## Configuration required

A Mac with Celedev CodeFlow version 1.0.3 or later, and Xcode 7 or later.

The LuaPanda application runs on a Mac with macOS 10,11 El Capitan or later.

## How to use this code sample

1. Open the CodeFlow project for this sample application.  
  This will automatically update the associated Xcode project, so that paths and other build settings are correctly set for your environment.

2. Open the associated Xcode project. You can do this in CodeFlow with the menu command `Program -> Open Xcode Project`.

3. Run the application.

4. Play with the Lua code, with 3D models, textures, particle generators… and benefit from the dynamic updates in the running app.

## Troubleshooting

- **Some libraries / header files in the sample app Xcode project are missing**

  **⇒ Fix**: simply open the corresponding CodeFlow project, and CodeFlow will update the associated Xcode project, so that paths and libraries are correctly set.
